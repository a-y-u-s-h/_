# _

This script is supposed to run after minimal
installation of Arch Linux. It will then do
everything that's needed to be done to recreate
an OS with pretty and useful defaults, with
choices for preferences wherever needed. After
that's done, it'll act as a TUI to
manage misc things related to OS - a
manager for personalization.
